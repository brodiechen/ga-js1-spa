There are two core features about my SPA, which are as follows:

1. Display a random list of ten pokemons that cause double demange for the pokemon types user puts in. For example, if the use inputs "ice" and "ghost" as pokemon types, the page will reach pokmon api and return data including the ten pokemons that cause double demange for "ice" and "ghost" pokemon types. 

2. Create and delete comments via firebase service.
